"""
This module is designed for extending the reinforcement_learning_utils functionality of the mlu application.
Developers can add custom reinforcement learning utilities here or extend the existing ones.

Instructions:
- Define your custom function or class.
- Ensure it follows the principles of reinforcement learning.
- Import and use core module functionalities if needed to avoid code duplication.
- Export your functions or classes by adding them to the __all__ list.

Example:
def custom_reward_function(state, action):
    # Example custom reward logic
    if action == 'expected_action':
        return 1  # Reward for taking the expected action
    else:
        return -1  # Penalty for not taking the expected action

__all__ = ['custom_reward_function']
