"""
This module is designed for extending the ethical_ai_utils functionality of the mlu application.
Developers can add custom ethical AI utility functions here or extend the existing ones.

Instructions:
- Define your custom function.
- Ensure it follows the ethical guidelines and principles.
- Import and use core module functionalities if needed to avoid code duplication.
- Export your functions by adding them to the __all__ list.

Example:
def custom_fairness_check(predictions, ground_truth):
    # Custom fairness checking logic
    fairness_report = "Fairness report..."
    return fairness_report

__all__ = ['custom_fairness_check']
"""

import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def custom_fairness_check(predictions, ground_truth):
    try:
        # Custom fairness checking logic
        fairness_report = "Fairness report..."
        logging.info("Custom fairness check completed successfully.")
        return fairness_report
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error("An error occurred during the custom fairness check: %s", e, exc_info=True)
        raise

__all__ = ['custom_fairness_check']  # Add the names of your custom functions here to make them available for import.
